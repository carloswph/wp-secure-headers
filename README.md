# WP Secure Headers Helper

A simple helper class to manage HTTP Security Headers made available when a website is under any SSL certificate. Unfortunately, many plugins are used to configure SSL, but miss the more elaborated part of it - include secure headers to requests. This class aims to offer a simple interface to set up those - bringing predefined headers adequate for most WP websites, but also enabling the coder to set or alter any header - and that may include customized HTTP headers as well.

# Installation

As we prefer, this library can be installed using Composer -- `composer require carloswph/wp-secure-headers`.
